			  The White Tiger is a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_tiger">Bengal</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_tiger">Siberian</a> tiger, known for its striking white fur with black or dark brown stripes which results from a recessive gene that affects pigmentation. Unlike albino tigers, they have blue eyes, a pink nose, and creamy white fur. They are predominantly found in captivity, as their unusual coloration makes them more susceptible to challenges in the wild, such as camouflage difficulties.
